        I started building my online career since <strong>2010</strong> which is the reason why I put this year to almost all my <strong>IDs</strong>. And I started working online in <strong>2011</strong>. At that time I did some data entry works for a few weeks and then moved on to <strong>Graphics Editing</strong>. I started learning <strong>Computer Programming</strong> using <strong>C</strong> in <strong>2015</strong> and I really liked it. After completing my graduation in the year <strong>2017</strong>, I started working hard and learning other languages that are used in <strong>Front-end Web development</strong>.

        <h5><strong>Work Principle and Aim:</strong></h5>
        <p>
          I learned almost everything from online. There is no teacher or guide to help me personally but I am greatful to all the instructors of different online courses that I took part in and all those YouTube video creators and bloggers who are really awesome to explain things. Whatever I need to know I prefer to do google searching rather asking and disturbing a lot of people. I am not a fast learner but I am an effective learner. I like to work with <strong>well-behaved, honest and serious </strong>people.

        <p>
          I don't like competition. I love what I do. Everyday I work hard and make improvement for becoming the best version of myself. I like to remain calm and lead a peaceful life. My aim is simple. I want to be a better programmer and a better human being. That's all.
        </p>
